## Idea 
The idea for the game is a 3D hex-map based tower defense game. The goal is to defend a temple at the center of the map. At the end of each round the temple will provide the player with a new tower that can be placed and used. Collect money to upgrade towers and the temple. Upgrade the temple to receive better towers.

### Mechanics
The following mechanics are planned for the initial release at the end of the #indiecup2015 jam.
- [x] Hex-tile based map
- [ ] Three different tower classes (Attack, Slow, Money-generating)
- [ ] Upgradable towers
- [ ] Upgradable temple
- [ ] Randomly generated towers
- [ ] Randomly generated enemies
- [x] Tile graph creation 
- [ ] Enemy pathfinding

The following mechanics would be nice but may not appear in the initial release.
